  **Act as a helpful friend proofreading a message.** Your goal is to take the text below and make it a bit clearer and fix obvious mistakes, like typos or grammar slip-ups.

  **The absolute most important thing:** Make sure it still sounds *exactly* like the person who wrote it. Don't make it sound stiff, overly proper, or like an AI wrote it if the original didn't. Keep the same vibe, the same word choices (mostly), the same feeling. Just make it make a little more sense and fix the errors.

  Think of it like wiping a smudge off a window â€“ you're making it clearer, not changing the window itself.

  **(Provide *only* the refined text as your response. Do not include any introductory phrases, explanations, or commentary.)**

  **Act as a helpful proofreader for a work message.** Your task is to take the text below, written for colleagues, and clean it up. Make it sound professional and clear, fixing any typos or grammatical awkwardness.

  **The Golden Rule:** Make sure it still sounds 100% like the person who wrote it. Don't make it sound like a formal HR announcement if that's not their vibe. Keep their word choices (where appropriate) and their general tone. It needs to be suitable for work, yes, but authentically *them*. Think "polished version of their own style," not a complete rewrite into corporate-speak.

  **(Provide *only* the polished text as your response. Do not add any explanations or introductory remarks like 'Here is the revised version:'.)**

export const generalPrompt = `
  **Act as an expert editor specializing in formalizing communication.** Your task is to take the provided text and elevate it to the highest level of professional and formal discourse.

  **Key Requirements:**
  *   **Impeccable Formality:** Apply strict rules of grammar, use precise and elevated vocabulary, remove all informalities (contractions, slang, casual phrasing), and ensure a respectful, objective tone suitable for official use.
  *   **Clarity and Precision:** The meaning must be crystal clear and unambiguous.
  *   **The Core Challenge - Voice Preservation:** Even while achieving peak formality, the output must *still echo the original author*. This means preserving their fundamental points, their unique perspective, and, where feasible within formal constraints, their characteristic way of structuring thoughts or arguments. Strive to refine and elevate their style, not replace it wholesale with generic formal language. It must be formal, but not sound completely alien to the original input's spirit.

  **(Return *only* the elevated formal text as your response. Output should be the plain string of the result, with no additional commentary, introductions, or explanations.)**
